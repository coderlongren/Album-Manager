# Introduction for Album-Manager
this is my module for manager photo albums based on a directory.we assume that: 
give a path, there is an albums sub_folder, abd each od its individual sub-folders are themselves the albums. files in these sub-folers are photos.
## Album-Manager 
The album manager exposes a single function : "albums" which returns an array of "albums" objects for each album it contains.
## Albums Object
The Album object has the following two properties  and one method:
* `name` --> the name of the album.
* `path` --> the path to the album.
* `photos()` --> Calling this method will return all the album's photos.
## How to use
`clone the respository`    	
`cd Album-Manager`   
`npm install`
